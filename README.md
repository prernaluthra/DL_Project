# Deep Learning Project Fall 2021
The goal of this project was to predict the MGMT promoter status using BRATS2021 dataset and computing the accuracy for the same. For this, we primarly tried 2 models: VGG16, ResNet50 or EfficientNetB3 to see which one gives us the best accuracy. 
Following are the steps to run the code:
## 1. Deep_Learning_Project_Fall_2021.ipynb
This file primarily contains the code for running BRATS2021 Dataset with VGG16, ResNet50 or EfficientNetB3

### Kaggle Notebook
We primarily ran the code as a Kaggle Notebook. 
The code can also be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/prernaluthra/dl-project

### Data Sources
1. We used the BRATS2021 dataset available here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification
2. Weights of the models: VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3

### How to run the code?
1. You can either clone the kaggle notebook OR you can clone this github repo ( specifically file Deep_Learning_Project_Fall_2021.ipynb)
2. Go to file `Deep_Learning_Project_Fall_2021.ipynb`
3. In the code cell `[In 132...]` of the notebook, you'll see the line
```
root_dir = '../input/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification/'
```
Replace this line so that it points to the path to BRATS2021 Dataset (as indicated in Data Sources Section).

4. Pick a model you would like to run (eg. VGG16). Make sure you add appropriate imports for it. Note that imports for VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetB3 are allready present.
5. In `Build Model` Section ( or `[In 139...]` code cell), you'll see the line
```
model = VGG16(include_top=False,weights=weights_path)
```
Repace this line with the model you would like to run. 

6. In the same code cell as above (3.), you'll see the line
```
model = Model(model.inputs, outputs, name="VGG16")
```
Repace this line with the model you would like to run. It should be the same as what you picked in 3.

7. In `Train Model` Section ( or `[In 140...]` code cell), you'll see the line
```
model = build_model("../input/vgg16-weights/vgg16_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5")
```
Repace this line with the path to weights of the appropriate model you chose in 3. and 4.

8. You should be all set!
